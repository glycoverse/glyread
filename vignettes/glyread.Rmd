## The Great Glycoproteomics Data Chaos 📊💥

Picture this: you've just finished running your glycoproteomics experiment through your favorite identification software—maybe pGlyco3,
MSFragger-Glyco, or Byonic.
You're excited to dive into the results,
but then reality hits: you're staring at a massive spreadsheet with 120+ columns,
cryptic column names,
and data scattered everywhere like confetti after a celebration gone wrong! 🎊

Sound familiar? Welcome to the wonderful world of glycoproteomics data formats! 😅

Each software tool speaks its own unique "dialect"—what one calls "Proteins,"
another might call "Protein.Accessions,"
and yet another prefers "UniProt_IDs."
It's like trying to have a conversation at the Tower of Babel,
but for data scientists.

**Enter glyread—your universal translator! 🌟**

Think of `glyread` as your personal data butler who speaks fluent "software chaos" and translates everything into beautiful,
organized, analysis-ready data.
No more wrestling with column names,
no more manual reformatting,
no more pulling your hair out over inconsistent formats.
Just clean, tidy data that's ready for the fun part: **actual analysis!**

**🎯 Important Note:** All functions in `glyread` return a `glyexp::experiment()` object—the lingua franca of the `glycoverse` ecosystem.
If you haven't met this elegant data structure yet,
we highly recommend taking a quick detour to [its introduction](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyexp/articles/glyexp.html) first.
Trust us, it's worth the journey! 🚀

```{r setup}
library(glyread)
library(glyexp)
library(readr)
```

## A Real-World Example: Taming the pGlyco3 + pGlycoQuant Beast 🐉

Let's dive into a classic glycoproteomics workflow that'll make you appreciate `glyread`'s magic!

**The Setup:** You're using pGlyco3 (the glycopeptide identification wizard 🧙‍♂️) paired with pGlycoQuant (the quantification maestro 🎼).
This dynamic duo is incredibly powerful, but their output?
Well, let's just say it's... comprehensive. 😅

Here's what a typical pGlycoQuant output file looks like:

```{r}
read_tsv("glycopeptides.list")
```

**Holy spreadsheet, Batman!** 🦇 That's 120 columns of pure, unadulterated data chaos!
While this comprehensive output is fantastic for software interoperability,
it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack when you just want to get to your analysis.

**What you actually need** (the needle in our haystack):

1. 🧬 **Glycoform descriptions**: proteins, sites, glycan compositions, glycan structures
2. 📊 **Quantification results**: the actual numbers from pGlycoQuant

**The old way:** Manually wrestling with this 120-column monster,
writing custom parsing scripts, debugging column name mismatches,
and generally questioning your life choices. 😵‍💫

**The glyread way:** One function call. Seriously. ✨

Meet `read_pglyco3_pglycoquant()`—your new best friend:

```{r}
exp <- read_pglyco3_pglycoquant("glycopeptides.list", sample_info = "sample_info.csv")
exp
```

🎪 **Ta-da!** Look at that beautiful transformation!
From 120-column chaos to organized elegance in one line of code.

Let's peek at what treasures we've extracted:

**🏷️ Variable Information - Meet Your Glycopeptides:**
```{r}
get_var_info(exp)
```

**📋 Sample Information - Know Your Experiments:**
```{r}
get_sample_info(exp)
```

**📊 Expression Matrix - Your Data's Heart and Soul:**
```{r}
get_expr_mat(exp)[1:5, ]
```

**The magic?** All the essential information for downstream analysis has been carefully extracted,
cleaned,
and packaged into a beautiful `glyexp::experiment()` object.
No more data archaeology—just clean, analysis-ready data! 🏺✨

## Peek Under the Hood: The Magic Explained 🔧✨

Curious about what just happened?
Let's lift the hood and see the sophisticated machinery that `read_pglyco3_pglycoquant()` runs behind the scenes.
Spoiler alert: it's doing **a lot** of heavy lifting so you don't have to! 💪

**The 8-Step Data Transformation Dance:** 💃

1. **📖 Smart File Reading**: Reads your data with intelligent column type detection—no more "everything is a character" surprises!
2. **🧹 Column Cleaning Magic**: Extracts clean UniProt accessions from messy "Proteins" columns and handles all those pesky formatting inconsistencies.
3. **🧠 Protein Inference Intelligence**: Runs a sophisticated "parsimony" algorithm to resolve protein assignment ambiguities—because biology is complicated,
but your data doesn't have to be!
4. **📊 PSM-to-Glycopeptide Aggregation**: Intelligently combines PSM-level quantification into meaningful glycopeptide-level measurements.
5. **✅ Sample Information Validation**: Cross-checks sample names and ensures everything matches up perfectly.
6. **🎯 Data Extraction**: Carefully extracts variable information and expression matrix while maintaining data integrity.
7. **🧬 Glycan Parsing Power**: Leverages the amazing [glyparse](https://github.com/glycoverse/glyparse) package to parse glycan compositions and structures into proper data types.
8. **📦 Final Assembly**: Packages everything into a beautiful, analysis-ready `experiment()` object.

**The result?** What used to take hours of custom scripting now happens in seconds,
with bulletproof reliability! 🛡️

and `glyread` is evolving right alongside it! 🚀

**💡 Pro Tip:** No matter which workflow you choose,
you can expect the same consistent,
clean data format on the other side.
It's like having a universal remote for your glycoproteomics data! 📺

## The Universal Data Language: Consistent Columns Across All Functions 🗣️

Here's the beautiful part: no matter which `glyread` function you use,
you'll always get the same consistent,
predictable data structure.
It's like having a universal translator that ensures everyone speaks the same language! 🌍

**🏷️ Your Variable Information Columns - The Standard Cast:**

- **`peptide`** 🧬: The peptide sequence (character) - your protein's building blocks
- **`peptide_site`** 📍: Glycosylation site on the peptide (integer) - where the magic happens
- **`protein`** 🏷️: UniProt accession (character) - your protein's official ID card
- **`protein_site`** 🎯: Glycosylation site on the protein (integer) - the full-length coordinates
- **`gene`** 🧬: Gene symbol (character) - the genetic blueprint behind it all
- **`glycan_composition`** 🧪: A `glyrepr::glycan_composition()` object - what's in your glycan
- **`glycan_structure`** 🏗️: A `glyrepr::glycan_structure()` object - how it's all connected

**🎯 Special Note on Those Last Two:** The `glycan_composition` and `glycan_structure` columns aren't just plain text—they're sophisticated data types from the amazing [glyrepr](https://github.com/glycoverse/glyrepr) package.
Think of them as smart objects that know how to do glycan math! 🧮

**💡 Pro Tip:** Getting familiar with `glyrepr` objects is absolutely worth the investment.
They unlock a whole world of glycan analysis capabilities that would be impossible with plain text.
Trust us on this one! 💪
