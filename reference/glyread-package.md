# glyread: Read and process glycomics and glycoproteomics data

Provides a unified interface for reading and processing quantification
results from various glycomics and glycoproteomics software tools,
including Byonic (ByoLogic, pGlycoQuant), StrucGP, pGlyco3
(pGlycoQuant), Glyco-Decipher, GlyHunter, and MSFragger. The package
standardizes raw data from different sources, performs peptide-spectrum
match (PSM) aggregation, parses glycan compositions and structures, and
converts the data into a standardized experiment object from the
'glyexp' package for downstream analysis within the glycoverse
ecosystem.
