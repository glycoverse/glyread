The goal of glyread is to read and process quantification results from
common glycomics and glycoproteomics software, such as Byonic, StrucGP,
or pGlyco, and convert them into a `glyexp::expriment()` object 
(from the [glyexp](https://github.com/glycoverse/glyexp) package)
for further analysis.

## Installation

You can install the latest release of glyread from [r-universe](https://glycoverse.r-universe.dev/glyread):

```r
install.packages('glyread', repos = c('https://glycoverse.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

Or from [GitHub](https://github.com/glycoverse/glyread):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glyread@*release")
```

Or install the development version:

``` r
remotes::install_github("glycoverse/glyread")
```

## Role in `glycoverse`

`glyread` is the entry point for the `glycoverse` ecosystem.
It provides a unified interface for reading and processing data from
various glycomics and glycoproteomics software, and converting them
into a `glyexp::experiment()` object for further analysis.

## Example

Used pGlyco3 and pGlycoQuant for glycopeptide identification and quantification?
Try `read_pglyco3_pglycoquant()`!

```R
library(glyread)

exp <- read_pglyco3_pglycoquant(
  "path/to/pGlyco3-pGlycoQuant/result/Quant.spectra.list",
  sample_info = "path/to/sample_info.csv",
  quant_method = "label-free",
  glycan_type = "N"
)
```
